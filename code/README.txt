This is the code we used to produce the figures in 

An iterated learning model of language change that mixes supervised
and unsupervised learning (2024)

Jack Bunyan, Seth Bullock, Conor Houghton

It should be possible to recreate any simulated data here, often the
actual simulated data used in the figures is also included

All the code is in the public domain and comes with the usual caveats,
like most scientific code it was only written to run once and,
although I am sure I could write stylish code, I didn't on this
occassion. Some day I will learn how to comment code.

The number of the folders is wrong, it refers to the original version
of the paper. In that version the figures for the oILM and ssILM were
different, one of the referees suggested reorganizing these so they
appear in the same figures. I didn't reorganize the folder since there
is a strong chance that everything would be messed up beyond all
repair. Instead there is a translation here.

FIGURE 1-3: these are introduction figures, there is no code with them

FIGURE 4:
ABC - this is the old FIGURE 4 ABC and are in fig4abc
DEF - old FIGURE 7 ABC
GHI - old FIGURE 7 DEF
so D-I are all in the folder fig789 bwhere they are called fig7abc and fig7def.
it is now labelled "fig:ailmGood"

FIGURE S0:
This is the old FIGURE 5 and is in fig5
