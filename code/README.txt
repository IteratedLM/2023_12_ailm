This is the code we used to produce the figures in 

An iterated learning model of language change that mixes supervised and unsupervised learning (2024)

Jack Bunyan, Seth Bullock, Conor Houghton

It should be possible to recreate any simulated data here, often the actual simulated data used in the figures is also included

If there are any questions or problems contact me at conor.houghton@bristol.ac.uk

All the code is in the public domain and comes with the usual caveats, like most scientific code it was only written to run once and, although I am sure I could write stylish code, I didn't on this occassion. Some day I will learn how to comment code.
