fig_2023_12_09: for the ailm with n=8 this calculates the performance
after two different generation lengths as a function of the number of
signals used when learning as an autoencoder. The output files look like
ailm_*_va.* and in the paper are labelled fig:ailm_va

fig_2023_12_10: for the oilm with n=8 this calculates the performance
as a function of generation. The output files look like oilm_*.png and
form the first row of the figure labelled fig:oilmGood

fig_2023_12_25: for the oilm with n in 6...12 calculated the number of
generations until all three performance measures exceed 0.95 for
difference sizes of the bottleneck, average the generation count over
25 trials and find the best bottleneck size. This is the figure
fig:oilmBottleneckSize and the files are oilm_best_*.png
