basically I make the ailm.csv file by cat on the relevant results
and then run plot.jl

For some reason when I run it locally the transparency doesn't work,
so I run this code on Blue Pebble - this is no longer true,
transparency doesn't work on Blue Pebble either, it is a complete
mystery, but I never actually needed transparency, I just lighten the
color instead.
