the data for n=10 vb was regenerated when I was making the eps figures
for PLoS. For reasons of confusion I plot both the vb and vr results
using the same plotting programme, in the vr case by changing the
column name by hand, which is a terrible but I hope forgiveable piece
of laziness.

no longer true:

not sure where the data for this figure - the old Fig S1 - went, it is
easy enough to run again, the results here though are the new Fig S1,
which has n=16 instead of n=10
